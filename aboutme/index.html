    <p>I am so excited to learn more and more about programming, that's why I
        have chosen 'Applied Technology' as the degree within BYU-I, I am
        currently working as a Spanish teacher and I have students arround the world, is
        amazing to know how technology can help us, nowdays, to connect with
        people from different parts of the world."

        I have been member of the church since I was born, and I was blessed with
        the oportunity to go to 'Paraguay Asuncion - North mission' It was a great
        experience helping people to know the Church.

        planning to get marriend next year, I am pretty excited about it, but at
        the same time, I am nervous, nevertheless I trust the Lord will guide us
        and help us achive all of our goals as we keep his commandments.</p>
