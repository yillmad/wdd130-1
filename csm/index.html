                <p class="paragraph">Manga is a Japanese style of comic books that originated in the late 19th century. The word "manga" 
                    means "whimsical pictures" in Japanese, and it quickly became a popular form of entertainment in Japan. The early 
                    manga were often comedic, and they were published in newspapers and magazines. However, the style and subject matter 
                    of manga have evolved over time, and it has become a widely recognized and respected art form around the world.

                    One of the most significant changes in manga's evolution was the introduction of "shonen manga" in the 1950s. Shonen 
                    manga is manga targeted towards young boys and often includes elements of action, adventure, and heroism. This genre 
                    became incredibly popular and led to the creation of many iconic manga series such as Dragon Ball, Naruto, and One Piece.</p>

                <p class="image-paragraph">Several mangakas have played a significant role in the evolution of manga. One such mangaka is Osamu 
                    Tezuka, who is often referred to as the "Godfather of Manga" and for good reason. 
                    He played a significant role in shaping the manga industry as we know it today. Tezuka's innovative storytelling 
                    techniques and artistic style transformed manga from a niche market to a mainstream phenomenon.
                    Tezuka's works, such as "Astro Boy" and "Kimba the White Lion," not only captured the hearts of readers in 
                    Japan but also gained popularity worldwide. His approach to character design and storytelling paved the way 
                    for future manga artists and helped to establish the distinct style and tropes that are now synonymous with manga.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Another group of mangakas that played a significant role in the evolution of manga are known as the "Big 
                    Three." This term refers to the three most influential shonen manga series of the 2000s: One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach. 
                    These series had a massive impact on the shonen manga genre and helped shape the direction of manga in the 21st century.

                    Akira Toriyama created the massively popular Dragon Ball series. His work had a significant impact on the shonen manga genre 
                    and helped shape the modern style of action and adventure manga.
                    Eiichiro Oda is the mangaka behind One Piece, which has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Oda's 
                    unique art style and storytelling techniques have had a significant influence on the shonen manga genre, and he has inspired 
                    many other mangakas. Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of Naruto, introduced many new elements to the shonen manga genre, 
                    including complex character relationships, political intrigue, and philosophical themes. Finally, Tite Kubo's Bleach broke 
                    new ground with its unique blend of action, supernatural elements, and humor. Together, these three series and their creators 
                    have helped shape the evolution of manga into the highly respected and widely popular art form it is today.</p>

                <p class="image-paragraph">Naoki Urasawa is my favorite manga, he is known for his intricate and suspenseful narratives that often explore 
                    omplex themes such as justice, identity, and humanity. Urasawa's contributions to the evolution of manga are significant, as 
                    he has helped to push the boundaries of what manga can be and what stories it can tell. He is often praised for his innovative 
                    storytelling techniques, which incorporate elements of suspense, mystery, and psychological drama, and for his ability to create 
                    fully-realized and multi-dimensional characters that resonate with readers.</p>

            <section class="paragraph-2">
                <p class="paragraph"> In addition to the previously mentioned mangakas, there are many other important figures who have helped 
                    shape the evolution of manga. Inio Asano is known for his introspective and psychological stories that often deal with themes of 
                    alienation and depression. His works, such as Solanin and Goodnight Punpun, have gained a following for their unique art style 
                    and thought-provoking narratives.

                    Kentaro Miura, on the other hand, is known for his dark fantasy epic, Berserk. The manga's detailed and intricate art style, 
                    combined with its complex characters and storylines, have made it a fan favorite for over three decades.
                    
                    Finally, Junji Ito is a master of horror manga, with works such as Uzumaki and Tomie being considered classics of the genre. 
                    His art style, which often features surreal and grotesque imagery, has been imitated by many other horror manga creators.

                    In conclusion, manga has come a long way since its humble beginnings in the late 19th century. It has evolved from a form of 
                    entertainment for children into a highly respected art form that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. From the 
                    pioneers of manga such as Osamu Tezuka to the Big Three of the 2000s, and the many other important mangakas in between, each has 
                    contributed to the rich and diverse tapestry that is manga. As the genre continues to evolve and grow, it is certain that new 
                    mangakas will emerge to push the boundaries even further and continue the legacy of this incredible art form.
