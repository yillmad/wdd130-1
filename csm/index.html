                <p class="image-paragraph">Several mangakas have played a significant role in the evolution of manga. One such mangaka is Osamu 
                    Tezuka, who is often referred to as the "Godfather of Manga" and for good reason. His approach to character design and 
                    storytelling paved the way for future manga artists and helped to establish the distinct style and tropes that are now synonymous with manga.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Manga has a rich and fascinating history that spans over a century. The origins of manga can be traced 
                    back to the late 19th century, when the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created a collection of drawings called "Hokusai 
                    Manga." These drawings were not comic books in the modern sense, but rather a collection of sketches that depicted everyday 
                    life in Japan.</p>
                    <p>In the early 20th century, manga began to take on a more modern form. The first true manga magazine, Shonen Sekai, was 
                    published in 1895. This magazine featured a mix of short stories, political satire, and illustrations. Over the years, 
                    manga evolved to include longer story arcs, more complex characters, and a wider range of genres.</p>
                    <p>During World War II, the Japanese government placed strict controls on the content of manga. Many manga artists were forced 
                    to create propaganda for the government, but some artists continued to produce underground manga that criticized the 
                    government and provided a voice for dissent.</p>
                    <p>In the 1950s, manga experienced a major shift with the introduction of "shonen manga." This genre was specifically targeted 
                    towards young boys and featured themes of action, adventure, and heroism. Shonen manga quickly became incredibly popular 
                    and led to the creation of many iconic manga series such as Dragon Ball, Naruto, and One Piece.</p>
                    <p>In the following decades, manga continued to evolve and diversify. New genres emerged, such as shojo manga (manga targeted 
                    towards young girls) and seinen manga (manga targeted towards adult men). Manga also began to gain popularity outside of 
                    Japan, with translations of popular series becoming available in other countries.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Another group of mangakas that played a significant role in the evolution of manga are known as the "Big 
                    Three." This term refers to the three most influential shonen manga series of the 2000s: One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach. 
                    These series had a massive impact on the shonen manga genre and helped shape the direction of manga in the 21st century.</p>
                    <p>Eiichiro Oda is the mangaka behind One Piece, which has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Oda's 
                    unique art style and storytelling techniques have had a significant influence on the shonen manga genre, and he has inspired 
                    many other mangakas. Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of Naruto, introduced many new elements to the shonen manga genre, 
                    including complex character relationships, political intrigue, and philosophical themes. Finally, Tite Kubo's Bleach broke 
                    new ground with its unique blend of action, supernatural elements, and humor. Together, these three series and their creators 
                    have helped shape the evolution of manga into the highly respected and widely popular art form it is today.</p>

                    <p class="image-paragraph">Naoki Urasawa is my favorite manga, he is known for his intricate and suspenseful narratives that often explore 
                    complex themes such as justice, identity, and humanity. Urasawa's contributions to the evolution of manga are significant, as 
                    he has helped to push the boundaries of what manga can be and what stories it can tell. </p>

                <div class="paragraph"> 
                    <p>In addition to the previously mentioned mangakas, there are many other important figures who have helped 
                    shape the evolution of manga. Inio Asano is known for his introspective and psychological stories that often deal with themes of 
                    alienation and depression. His works, such as Solanin and Goodnight Punpun, have gained a following for their unique art style 
                    and thought-provoking narratives.</p>
                    <p>Kentaro Miura, on the other hand, is known for his dark fantasy epic, Berserk. The manga's detailed and intricate art style, 
                    combined with its complex characters and storylines, have made it a fan favorite for over three decades.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Junji Ito is a master of horror manga, with works such as Uzumaki and Tomie being considered classics of the genre. 
                    His art style, which often features surreal and grotesque imagery, has been imitated by many other horror manga creators.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, manga has come a long way since its humble beginnings in the late 19th century. It has evolved from a form of 
                    entertainment for children into a highly respected art form that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. From the 
                    pioneers of manga such as Osamu Tezuka to the Big Three of the 2000s, and the many other important mangakas in between, each has 
                    contributed to the rich and diverse tapestry that is manga. As the genre continues to evolve and grow, it is certain that new 
                    mangakas will emerge to push the boundaries even further and continue the legacy of this incredible art form.</p>
