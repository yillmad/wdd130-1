        The origins of manga can be traced back to Japan in the late 19th century, with the publication of the first-ever 
        manga magazine, Eshinbun Nipponchi, in 1874. Over the years, manga has evolved into a unique art form that is distinct 
        from other forms of comics. Manga often features distinctive character designs, panel layouts, and narrative 
        structures that set it apart from traditional Western comic books.
        <br>
        Manga is published in a variety of magazines, each targeting a specific demographic and genre. For example, Shonen Jump 
        magazine features action and adventure stories aimed at young male readers, while Shojo Beat magazine focuses on romance 
        and relationships for teenage girls. Other popular manga magazines include Young Jump, Big Comic, and Morning, each with 
        their own unique style and themes.
        <br>
        Throughout the history of manga, many talented authors and artists have contributed to its development and popularity. 
        Osamu Tezuka, known as the "God of Manga," is credited with popularizing the medium in Japan in the 1940s and 1950s. 
        His works, such as Astro Boy and Black Jack, helped to establish many of the conventions that are now associated with 
        manga. Other influential manga creators include Rumiko Takahashi (Inuyasha), Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball), and Naoko 
        Takeuchi (Sailor Moon), whose works have inspired countless readers and helped to establish the popularity of manga worldwide.
