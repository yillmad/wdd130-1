        Manga is a Japanese style of comic books that originated in the late 19th century. The word "manga" 
        means "whimsical pictures" in Japanese, and it quickly became a popular form of entertainment in Japan. The early 
        manga were often comedic, and they were published in newspapers and magazines. However, the style and subject matter 
        of manga have evolved over time, and it has become a widely recognized and respected art form around the world.

        One of the most significant changes in manga's evolution was the introduction of "shonen manga" in the 1950s. Shonen 
        manga is manga targeted towards young boys and often includes elements of action, adventure, and heroism. This genre 
        became incredibly popular and led to the creation of many iconic manga series such as Dragon Ball, Naruto, and One Piece.
        <br>
        Several mangakas have played a significant role in the evolution of manga. One such mangaka is Osamu 
        Tezuka, who is often referred to as the "Godfather of Manga" and for good reason. 
        He played a significant role in shaping the manga industry as we know it today. Tezuka's innovative storytelling 
        techniques and artistic style transformed manga from a niche market to a mainstream phenomenon.
        Tezuka's works, such as "Astro Boy" and "Kimba the White Lion," not only captured the hearts of readers in 
        Japan but also gained popularity worldwide. His approach to character design and storytelling paved the way 
        for future manga artists and helped to establish the distinct style and tropes that are now synonymous with manga.
        <br>
        Another group of mangakas that played a significant role in the evolution of manga are known as the "Big 
        Three." This term refers to the three most influential shonen manga series of the 2000s: One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach. 
        These series had a massive impact on the shonen manga genre and helped shape the direction of manga in the 21st century.

        Akira Toriyama created the massively popular Dragon Ball series. His work had a significant impact on the shonen manga genre 
        and helped shape the modern style of action and adventure manga.
        Eiichiro Oda is the mangaka behind One Piece, which has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Oda's 
        unique art style and storytelling techniques have had a significant influence on the shonen manga genre, and he has inspired 
        many other mangakas. Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of Naruto, introduced many new elements to the shonen manga genre, 
        including complex character relationships, political intrigue, and philosophical themes. Finally, Tite Kubo's Bleach broke 
        new ground with its unique blend of action, supernatural elements, and humor. Together, these three series and their creators 
        have helped shape the evolution of manga into the highly respected and widely popular art form it is today.
        <br>
        Naoki Urasawa is my favorite manga, he is known for his intricate and suspenseful narratives that often explore 
        complex themes such as justice, identity, and humanity. Urasawa's contributions to the evolution of manga are significant, as 
        he has helped to push the boundaries of what manga can be and what stories it can tell. He is often praised for his innovative 
        storytelling techniques, which incorporate elements of suspense, mystery, and psychological drama, and for his ability to create 
        fully-realized and multi-dimensional characters that resonate with readers.
