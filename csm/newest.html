                    <p class="paragraph-card">When it comes to manga, the terms "old gen" and "new gen" are often used to describe 
                        different eras of manga and the styles, themes, and trends that were popular during those periods.

                        Old gen manga typically refers to manga series that were created before the 2000s, often characterized by 
                        distinct art styles and storytelling techniques. These manga series tended to focus on traditional genres 
                        such as action, romance, and comedy, and often had a more episodic structure.
                        
                        On the other hand, new gen manga generally refers to manga series that have been created in the past two 
                        decades or so. These manga often feature more diverse themes and styles, with a greater emphasis on character 
                        development, storytelling, and social commentary. Many new gen manga also incorporate elements of popular 
                        culture, such as video games, anime, and social media.
                        
                        New gen manga has also been influenced by changes in technology, with many manga series now being published 
                        digitally as well as in print. This has led to the rise of webtoons and other online manga platforms, which 
                        have helped to democratize the manga industry and give more opportunities to up-and-coming manga creators.
                        
                        Overall, both old gen and new gen manga have their own unique qualities and strengths, and both continue to 
                        be popular among manga fans around the world.</p>
